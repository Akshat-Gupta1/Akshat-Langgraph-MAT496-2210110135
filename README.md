This repository contains my learning journey through the LangGraph course from LangChain Academy.

## About This Repository

This project demonstrates my understanding of building custom agents with LangGraph, covering:
- Agent architectures and workflows
- State management and memory
- Human-in-the-loop interactions
- Advanced patterns like parallelization and map-reduce

## Modules

- **Module 1**: Introduction to LangGraph - Basic concepts, chains, routers, and agents
- **Module 2**: State and Memory - Managing state, reducers, and persistent memory
- **Module 3**: UX and Human-in-the-Loop - Streaming, breakpoints, and user feedback
- **Module 4**: Building Your Assistant - Advanced topics including parallelization, sub-graphs, and research assistants

Work in progress...
